## CNN Semantic Segmentation
**Real Estate Image Recognition Search within 20 miles of Harvard**  

*Team 10: David Crowe, Nicolas Garza, Cynthia Gao*

## Project Description
The objective of the project is to leverage a combinatorial neural network (CNN), big data & cloud computing to create an image recognition system that detects specific apartment attributes from photos. The CNN will be deployed to the web via a Flask app integrating D3 vizualization, allowing users to easily view and interpret the results. The results of the CNN will also be combined with other apartment data to predict listing price and days on the market, this combining deep learning networks and big data to create a powerful apartments analytic platform.  



## Project Approach
We will use an agile approach with weekly sprints for various parts of the project. An outline of the objectives for each sprint can be found below:

### Sprint 1: Develop Flask Web App (due date = 7/15)

| Project Planning | Build Process Book & push to Github | TBD |  |
| Project Planning | Write user stories for this week's tasks & post to process book by EOD 7/8 | David |  |
| Web Application | Initialize Flask App, add base template, add register & login functionality, & deploy to Heroku | David |  |
| Web Application | Design database, implement in Postgres & upload data | TBD | |
| Web Application | Leverage Bootstrap to develop landing page & template for apartment listing pages | |


### Sprint 2: Neural Network (due date = 7/22)

| Area | Task | Task Owner | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- | ----- |
